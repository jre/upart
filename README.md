A toy for examining partition maps

This will read a hierarchy of partition maps in various formats from a disk or disk image. It was initially created as a personal learning tool for partition maps in general, and to have a simple too which could be built easily on any operating system which I used.

It is unlikely that it will be of use to anyone else but there is also no purpose in keeping it private, so it's here on github for anyone who wants it.

It is a simple ./configure && make install to build and install the binary and a manpage.
