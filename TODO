non-partitions:
  filesystem detection
  lvm
test with different sector sizes
make output less unreadable, especially for virtdisks
multi-disk support
  allow virtual disks to span multiple physical
softraid
  v3 and v4 metadata format
  validate all optional metadata
  attempt to validate chunks and print raid status
  support other raid types
    0, P (4/5), 6, concat
  tests
    metadata versions
    raid levels
    nested map types
    nested softraid
    key disks and hot spares
windows 7 device permissions
sector deduplication when saving images
disklabel
  more testing with labels from other BSDs
  some way to tell which BSD wrote a label?
apple map
  fix bzb
better overall description in manpage
option to change displayed offset/size units
interactive restore mode for dumps
tests:
  add images with just one map format, to make failures easier to diagnose
    make these run before the jre-* images with multiple maps
    disklabel from net/free/dragonfly plus both big and little endian openbsd
    weird extended mbr configurations, both valid and invalid ones
  add tests that fail all the various checks when reading an image
    header too small/big
    bad header/body crc
  relaxed checks for some images
    add tests to trigger all relaxable checks
  there should be a test for every single error message, except i/o or resource
  run tests for a specific set of images instead of all of them
  image with sector headers describing zero sectors
document image format
move more sun common code and defines into shared header?
other extended mbr ID?
try to get bus errors from misaligned packed structures on sparc with sunpro or gcc
  yea, looks like sunpro on sparc with -m64 will do it, this needs to be fixed
