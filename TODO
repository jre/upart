make output less unreadable
test with different sector sizes
disklabel
  openbsd v1 labels
  more testing with labels from other BSDs
  some way to tell which BSD wrote a label?
sun sparc label
  test vtoc
apple map
  fix bzb
filesystem tasting
better overall description in manpage
option to change displayed offset/size units
interactive restore mode for dumps
use PACKAGE_NAME instead of "upart" everywhere
tests:
  add images with just one map format, to make failures easier to diagnose
    make these run before the jre-* images with multiple maps
    disklabel from net/free/dragonfly plus both big and little endian openbsd
    weird extended mbr configurations, both valid and invalid ones
  add tests that fail all the various checks when reading an image
    header too small/big
    bad header/body crc
  relaxed checks for some images
    add tests to trigger all relaxable checks
  there should be a test for every single error message, except i/o or resource
  run tests for a specific set of images instead of all of them
  image with sector headers describing zero sectors
document image format
move more sun common code and defines into shared header?
other extended mbr ID?
