The upart partition image is used to store disk metadata, such as
geometry, as well as the contents of any disk sectors known to contain
partition information.  A partition map may later be extracted from an
image which should be identical to that extracted from the original
disk.

This document describes version 1.0 of the upart image format.

The image format consists of the main image header followed by zero or
more sector groups.  Each sector group consists of a sector header
followed by zero or more sectors of data.  All integer values used in
the main and sector headers are unsigned and in big-endian byte order.

The contents of the main image header are as follows:

Magic number - 64 bits.  The byte sequence 55 50 41 52 54 ea f2 e5.
Major version - 16 bits.  See below for format version handling.
Minor version - 16 bits.  See below for format version handling.
Header length - 32 bits.  The length of this header.  Must be 328 for version 1.0
Header CRC32 - 32 bits.
Data offset - 32 bits.
Data size - 32 bits.
Data CRC32 - 32 bits.
Sector size - 32 bits.
Unused - 32 bits.
Disk sector count size - 64 bits.
Disk cylinder count - 64 bits.
Disk head count - 64 bits.
Disk sectors per track - 64 bits.
Human-readable label - 256 bytes.
